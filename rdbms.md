# Relational Database Management System.

## RDBMS
- This concept indicates to the sofware system that is utilized to connect and 
to maintain a relational database.

- Data is stored in a structural form  using rows and columns

- the table's values are associated to each other.

- Table can be related to other tables.

- For querying and managing data within a relational database,
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is implemented.

- Many RDBMSs use their own particular dialect of SQL, 
which may have certain limitations or extensions.

- These extensions include extra features that allow users 
to perform complex operations.

## Keys
- PRIMARY KEY: A combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL, 
the PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that no entry in the column is NULL 
and that every entry is distinct.

- FOREIGN KEY: is a column in one table that refers to 
the PRIMARY KEY of another table. This constraint is used to link 
two tables together: entries to the FOREIGN KEY column must already 
exist in the parent PRIMARY KEY column for the write process to succeed.
